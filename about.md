### What am I doing now?
I'm an army cyber warfare officer living in the DC area. I work on data science, machine learning, and computing problems for army cyber command and DARPA.

When I'm not at work you can probably find me reading a book, writing code, or trying to learn something new.

### How did I get here?
<!-- I started getting curious about math (especially quantitative finance) as an undergraduate at West Point, where I studied engineering and wrote a thesis on using option-implied volatility distributions to better inform portfolio optimization.

Upon graduation in 2012 I worked for a nonprofit financial development institution as a pro bono data analyst while waiting to begin my studies as a Rotary Ambassadorial Scholar in the UK. My research resulted in a published analysis of liquidity in regional manufactured housing markets which was used to gain philanthropic funding. My interest in data began to deepen. -->

I fell in love with __machine learning__ while writing my master's thesis at the University of Edinburgh in 2013. I spent the next few years as the chief communications officer for a mechanized reconnaissance squadron in Germany, but devoted my nights and weekends to teaching myself R and python.

I was recruited for the army's new cyber warfare branch, and was stationed in DC in 2016 to do data science. I'm involved in research efforts in academia, the army, and at the joint / department of defense level. I can provide more detail <strong>[here on my résumé](../resume)</strong>, or on <strong>[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholasnormandin/)</strong>.
